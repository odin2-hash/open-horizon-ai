async def get_session_context(ctx: RunContext[AgentDependencies]) -> str:
    """Generate context-aware instructions based on user session and project state."""
    context_parts = []
    
    if ctx.deps.user_role:
        context_parts.append(f"User role in Open Horizon: {ctx.deps.user_role}")
    
    if ctx.deps.current_project:
        context_parts.append(f"Current project context: {ctx.deps.current_project.title}")
